abstract: 'This study examines whether the sovereign credit market integrates information on coastal flooding and sea level rise (SLR) hazards. Using credit default swap spreads as measures of credit quality, I find that medium-to long-term risk for sovereigns with a significant portion of their population vulnerable to ex-ante coastal flooding increases in response to climate summit news. Additionally, I document that the market asynchronously incorporates changing vulnerabilities of regions into its risk assessment with such news. In-and out-of-sample predictability tests suggest that the market lags in integrating adverse trends in exposure under projections of SLR and population growth, indicating a lack of attention to complex climate information. Finally, I demonstrate that these projections have historically been inaccurate, leading to mispricing.'
