I am a PhD candidate in Financial Technology at the University of Edinburgh Business School and will be on the 2024-2025 job market. My research focuses on how evolving climatic patterns impact financial markets and corporate dynamics, with a particular interest in applying geospatial climate and environmental data.

I am a visiting scholar at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University for the Fall 2024 semester. I will also present at the PRI Academic Conference in Toronto from October 7th to 10th and the American Finance Association from January 3rd to 5th. Say hi if you see me!
